# ZenActions

A simple, yet powerful tool to reuse business logic in the view layer.

`ZenActions` is the first of 2 packages to help build your Meteor app in a `"Flux"-like manner`. `ZenActions` allow you to
abstract business logic from your views into digestable chunks to use between `Blaze` Templates or `React` Components.

I wrote a blog post about this package here [ZenActions](https://medium.com/@abhiaiyer/zenactions-972e5c61c30c#.h55t6cxye)

Example app (BLAZE) here [ZenActions example](https://github.com/abhiaiyer91/ZenScope-Blaze)

### Getting Started

Add `ZenActions` to your app:

```shell
meteor add zenflux:actions
```
### Mixins

`ZenActions` are powered by the concept of mixins. What is a mixin? A mixin is a plain object in which its values are functions
(ideally, [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) but is also great for state mutations)

Let's look at how we register mixins.

#### ZenMixins.registerMixin(name, object)
Register a function the Mixin namespace

```js
// We want to share functionality between 2 views. For this example, let's say
// we need to share a function that creates a post in forum
ZenMixins.registerMixin('createPostMixin', {
  // a function that calls submitPost meteor methods and handles some side effects
  createPost(postData, postVisibilityStore, callback) {
     return Meteor.call('submitPost', postData, function (e, r) {
       if (!e) {
          // we passed some reactive var from our view to set some flag after our method has been called
          postVisibilityStore.set(false);
          // some callback function
          if (_.isFunction(callback) {
            return callback();
          }
       }
     });
  },
  // We want to have a function to toggle the post box on and off
  togglePostBox(postVisibilityStore) {
    return postVisibilityStore.set(true);
  }
});
```

Awesome! Now I have a reusable piece of code to use between any views that need this functionality. As you can see, all we need to
use this mixin is some `postData` (which can come from your views data) and some `reactive variable/dict/session `

Important Information:

* `Mixins` are really convenient in a package based architecture. This way you can assure that your mixin is registered before using it, and you can also control mixin dependencies between views.


### Actions

The way we utilize our actions is via a `ZenAction`

#### ZenAction([mixins])

A`ZenAction` is a factory that takes registerd mixins and "mixes" them into its instance object. We then bind this object to the instance of our
`Blaze` Template or `React` Component.

### Blaze Example

Lets say we have the same create post example from the mixins section

Our markup would look something like this:

```handlebars
  <template name="postSubmitComponent">
    <div>
      <div>
        <button class="ev-toggle-box">Toggle Post Box</button>
      </div>
      {{#if postBoxToggled}}
        <div>
          <input type="text"/>
          <button class="ev-submit-post">Submit Post</button>
        </div>
      {{/if}}
    </div>
  </template>
```

Our template code will look something like this:

```js
// onCreated we will bind the ZenAction to the template instance
Template.postSubmitComponent.onCreated(function () {
  var template = this;
  // set up a reactive var
  template.postVisibilityStore = new ReactiveVar(false);
  // I bind the ZenAction to the oncreated so now throughout my lifecycle i have access to these methods mixed in
  template.actionCreator = ZenAction(['createPostMixin']);
});
```

```js
// Setup the visibility helper
Template.postSubmitComponent.helpers({
  postBoxToggled() {
    var template = Template.instance();
    return template.postVisibilityStore.get();
  }
});
```

```js
// now in our event we make magic happen
Template.postSubmitComponent.events({
  'click .ev-submit-post': function (event, template) {
     // grab the post data from the template
     let postData = template.data.postData;
     // get the post visibility store
     let postVisibilityStore = template.postVisibilityStore;
     // call create post
     return template.actionCreator.createPost(postData, postVisibilityStore, function () {
       // do something here
     });
  },
  'click .ev-toggle-box': function (event, template) {
    // get the post visbility store
    let postVisibilityStore = template.postVisibilityStore;
    return template.actionCreator.togglePostBox(postVisibilityStore);
  }
});
```

### React Example

I prefer `ES2015` syntax for `React`, but we can also write this in `createClass`. Let me know if you get tripped up, and i'll put an example that way.


```jsx
import React from 'react';
import reactMixin from 'react-mixin';
const PostSubmitBox = (submitPostClick) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text"/>
      <button onClick={submitPostClick}>Submit Post</button>
    </div>
  )
};
class PostSubmitComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    // in the constructor bind our necessary tools
    super();
    this.actionCreator = ZenAction(['createPostMixin']);
    this.postVisibilityStore = new ReactiveVar(false);
    this.toggleBox = this.toggleBox.bind(this);
    this.submitPost = this.submitPost.bind(this);
    this.postBoxToggle = this.postBoxToggle.bind(this);
    // using state here but wont hook up how this changes, so use your imagination
    this.state = {
      postData: {}
    }
  }
  submitPost() {
    let postData = this.state.postData;
    let postVisibilityStore = this.postVisibilityStore;
    return this.actionCreator.createPost(postData, postVisibilityStore);
  }
  toggleBox() {
     // get the post visbility store
      let postVisibilityStore = this.postVisibilityStore;
      return this.actionCreator.togglePostBox(postVisibilityStore);
  }
  postBoxToggle() {
    return this.postVisiblityStore.get();
  }
  render() {
    let postBoxComponent;
    // if visibility is on
    if (this.postBoxToggle()) {
      postBoxComponent = <PostSubmitBox submitPostClick={this.submitPost}/>
    } else {
      postBoxComponent = null;
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <div>
          <button onClick={this.toggleBox}>Toggle Post Box</button>
        </div>
        {postBoxComponent}
      </div>
    )
  }
}
reactMixin(PostSubmitComponent.prototype, TrackerReact);
```

You can take the `React` example further with `Flux` implementations. More on that soon.

### Why?

Why is this pattern good? Out of the box `Blaze` does not have the component system, nor the ability to abstract functionality
between templates. First people will say.... "USE BLAZE COMPONENTS". Well that api is too huge, and not in my interest. At Workpop we
have achieved a tremendous amount of reusability by keeping our api simple and in our OWN CONTROL.

For `React`? Even with the component system, you will be adding your action layer somewhere. Whether you use redux or vanilla flux...actions
will live somewhere. Utilize the `ZenActions` package as your action layer. Let it bridge your UI and your business logic in a minimal, and powerful way.
You get to decide the shape of your actions, there is no "right" way...only a vehicle to do so.
